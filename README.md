# How to Play
***
When you run the game, you will be presented with a option for the help screen, and an option to start the game.
The cheat mode and difficulty do not do anything yet. When you click start, you will see one of each piece on the board.
You can click each piece and move it to a square that you will see will be blue. The pieces should not be able to move to a square that is not blue.
When you are tired of moving pieces around, click the 'x' in the upper right corner to close the game.
